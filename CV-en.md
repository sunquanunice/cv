# Introduction
I'm a full stack developer. My preferred programming language is JAVA and I wish to be an expert in JAVA. Fortunately, I have lots of opportunities to learn and practice some complicated backend subjects in my current work, such as performance improvement with multiple threads within a powerful server, design, implement and maintain various tasks across multiple components in an integrated environment, etc. I also have very solid UI development skill, I have been making great contribution in UI for my whole professional career. My long term career goal is to be an architect.
